I'm a web developer in Milwaukee, WI. I'm focused on frontend web development, but I also have experience with C# and .NET Core. I'm passionate about web accessibility, and I've started [writing](/blog) and [speaking](/speaking) about it. I have an insatiable appetite for learning new technologies, and I thrive when working on challenging projects with creative people.
